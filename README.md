# Advanced-Predictive-Modelling-Coursework
Advanced Predictive Modelling course in Fall laid the foundation for the predictive modelling and machine learning techniques currently being used extensively in the industry for solving a multitude of business problems

The above set of files constitute part of the work done to understand and execute some of the most important modelling technqiues. The questions are both conceptual and implementation based. Below is the curriculum for this course:

1. Overview and Recap: Types of predictive analytics; Local vs. global models; Role within data mining process, Software demos; Multivariate regression; Tackling Big Data (2 lectures) Objective: Recap and revise key concepts from Introductory Predictive modeling course)  
2. Advanced Multivariate regression (partly revision): Basis function expansion; Dealing with large number of features; Ridge, Lasso and Stagewise Approaches; Nonlinear methods;. Introduction to neural nets and deep learning. User's guide. (5 lectures) Objective:  Learn to design, understand and implement predictive models where desired outcome is a numeric quantity. 
3. Bayesian approach: (1 lecture) Intro to Multilevel models. (notes) Objective: Exposure to Bayesian methodology for tying multiple models together. 
4. Data Pre-Processing (Brief): Transformations, Imputations, Outlier detection (2 lectures)  Objective: Understand that good data quality is a pre-requisite for effective models, and study some methods for improving data quality. 
5. Classification: Bayes decision theory, Na√Øve Bayes and Bayesian networks; (Scaled) Logistic regression; LDA; Catboost, Scaling decision trees to big data; Kernel methods and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification and regression; dealing with class imbalance. (5 lectures) Objective: Learn to design, understand and implement predictive models where desired outcome is a class label. 
6. Ensemble Methods: Model Averaging, Bagging and Random forests, boosting, Gradient boosting; Bag of Little Bootstraps (2 lectures) Objective: Understand the benefits of combining multiple predictive models.
